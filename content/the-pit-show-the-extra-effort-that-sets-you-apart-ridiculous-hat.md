title: The Extra Effort That Sets You Apart - Ridiculous Hat
---

<p>My guest this week is Ridiculous Hat.</p><p>Hat is a podcaster for the coin concede podcast. Their goal is to take the competitive side of the Hearthstone collectible card game more approachable for the everyday player.</p><p>I’ve been listening to Hat’s podcast for a few months and through getting to know him and the community he runs with friends and fellow players, there were two things that really impressed me:</p><ol>
<li>The podcast is produced extremely well in spite of the fact that none of the core hosts that run the podcast do that or play hearthstone full time.</li>
<li>The crew does not seem to be entirely devoted to Hearthstone and this allows them to approach the show with a non-biased critique that is valuable for any player of any game.</li>
</ol><p>In this conversation I learn a bit more about Hat’s background with audio as well as his relationship with his hobby and why he doesn’t plan to make it a full time thing.</p><p><strong><br />Connect with Hat<br /></strong><br /></p><ul>
