<p>In the first episode of Ask a Brit, Jay (US) and Jay (UK) discuss the things that the US does better than the UK, and vice versa. This was based on a <a href="https://twitter.com/ejbarnes89/status/1080112677190619137">question prompt from EJ Barnes</a> on twitter.</p><p>Her question was:</p>What do you think US does better than UK? And vice versa?<p><br />And what does the UK do better than the US?</p><p>... One word - RACISM!</p><p>If you want your question to be discussed on the show, send it in with the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AskABrit?src=hash">AskABrit hashtag</a>.</p><p>Ask a Brit is a proud member of <a href="http://jayandjay.media">Jay and Jay Media</a>.
