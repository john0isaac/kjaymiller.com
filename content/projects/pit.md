[Productivity in Tech](https://productivityintech.com) (or PIT for short) is the longest _still running_ project
for me.

It started with the [podcast](https://productivityintech.transistor.fm) where I talked apps (my love and hate for them) and
then moved into my fascination with people working beyond the apps. 

This passion has pushed me past the idea of just creating content and I have
mirrored that with my passion to help others in many creative ways. 

Under the PIT name, I do [coaching](https://productivityintech.com/coaching)
but also do developer [content edting and creation services](https://productivityintech.com/editing). 
This means helping develoeprs who are helping developers.
