I had the pleasure of being a guest on Brett Terpstra's [_Systematic_][systemcast] Podcast. 

I'm a big fan of [Brett's](https://brettterpstra.com) and long time listener of his show. It was an amazing experience to have someone that I look up to in the industry have me on as their guest like **I'm a professional** or something. 

Check out [the episode][systemcast] - I covered a lot about what I do in my day job, my thoughts on productivity and how I've been able to continue to grow in the space.
