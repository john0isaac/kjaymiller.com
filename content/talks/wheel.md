^ Does anyone know what this is?
No, it's not a torture device.
It's rotary tiller wheel.

^ I want to show you that for many of us, our use of python is like creating this over and over again.

^ many people using python outside of traditional spaces have to have pretty good imaginations.

# What is invention?

> Invention is

> 3% perspiration 
> 2% butter scotch ripple. - Willy Wonka

^ I take this to mean that in doing anything it's all about the work that you put in and looking at what is already there.

# For those that don't get paid to think about python, 
  We don't know when we are reinventing the wheel.

# It's _OUR_ job to make _rotary tillers_

^ A large part of being a python developer is creating a "tiller hoe wheel". That's taking two things, and jamming them together to do something totally different.

Render Engine (The Idea)

- Static Site Generation with Flask Like Flexibility
- Use tools like `Markdown`, `Jinja`
- So _un-opinionated_ you could make it w/e you wanted.

---

## Site - A Collection of Pages and Collections

![inline fit](https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/pb-HOBMj9qmOd.png)

* global variables and things

---

```python
from render_engine import Site, Page, Collection

mysite = Site()

<SITE CODE>

mysite.render()

```

---

## Engine

### Jinja2 (Default)
### If you build your own or add another you just need two things.
- `myEngine.environment`
- `myEngine.render()`

----

## Basic Page

```python
@mysite.register_route()
class Index(Page):
    template = 'index.html'
```

---

## Extended Basic Page

```python

@register_route('/index.html')
class Index(Page):
    template = 'index.html'
    index_content = {
            'promo': '',
            'promo_image': '',
            }
```

---

```
@register_route('/DeveloperonFire.html')
def index_dev_on_fire(Index):
    index_content = index()
    index_content['promo'] = 'Dave Rael trusts PIT to make him sound great!'
    index_content['promo_image'] = 'https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kjaymiller/images/developeronfire.png'
    return index_content

@register_route('/dotnetcore')
def NetCoreBlog(Index):
    index_content['promo'] = '.Net Core Blog trusts PIT to make him sound great!'
    index_content['promo_image'] = 'https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kjaymiller/images/Netcore.png'
    return index_content

```

---

````html
<!-- templates/index.html -->
{% if index_content['promo'] %}
<div class="hero is-primary is-large">
<h1>{{promo}}</h1>
</div>
{% endif %}
```
---

## A Collections Of Pages

```python
@mysite.register_collection
class Pages(Collection):
    routes = ["", "pages"]
    content_path = "content/pages"
    template = "page.html"

```

---
```python
class Collection:
    engine = ''
    page_content_type = Page
    content_path = "content"
    template = "page.html"
    includes = ["*.md", "*.html"]
    routes = ['']
    has_archive = False
    _archive_template = "archive.html"
    _archive_slug = "all_posts"
    _archive_content_type = Page
    _archive_reverse = False
    feeds = [feeds.RSSFeed]

    @staticmethod
    def _archive_default_sort(cls):
        return cls.slug
```

---

```
class Blog(Collection):
    page_content_type = BlogPost
    has_archive = True
    routes = ['', 'blog']
    template = 'blog_post'
  
    @staticmethod
    def _archive_default_sort(cls):
        return cls.date
```

## Things to Think About in Adding Spikes to a Wheel

----

![fit right](https://dsc.cloud/kjmScreenshots/Safari-Screenshot-2020-02-29-08.02.49.jpg)

## Make sure you are allowed to (Licensing)
### and make sure you allow others
  - <https://choosealicense.com>

---

## Make sure your wheel is sturdy
  
- Pick Tools that are well supported
- Longevity != Sturdiness
- Testing & Code Coverage
- `pytest`, `unittest`, `pytest-cov`, `coverage`
