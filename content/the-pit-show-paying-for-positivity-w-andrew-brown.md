<p>Andrew is a digital marketing strategist and host of <a href="https://thehappyhearthstone.com">The Happy Hearthstone Podcast</a>, the verified longest running Hearthstone Podcast!</p><p>Andrew has used his marketing skills and general optimistic nature to successfully take over this project from it's original founder and  transform it into a community of gamers that work to spread knowledge and positivity in the space.</p><p>People know that I am an avid Hearthstone player, but most don't know that I am an <em>Executive Producer</em> level backer of the show which comes with free Hearthstone coaching. I gave up this month's coaching session to schedule this interview with Andrew because I truly believe there is a <strong>MASSIVE</strong> benefit in working to not only be a source of knowledge but also a source of encouragement and positivity.<br /></p><p><b>Connect with our PIT Community</b></p><p><br /></p><p> Join the <a href="https://productivityintech.palapa.co/">PIT Community Forums</a> and leave your feedback about <a href="https://productivityintech.palapa.co/post/15751">this episode</a>!</p><p><br /></p><p> You can also join our free newsletter and more at <a href="https://productivityintech.com/">https://productivityintech.com</a></p><p><br /></p><p><br />Connect with me (Jay) on <a href="https://twitter.com/kjaymiller">Twitter</a> and Keep up to date on all things PIT at<a href="https://twitter.com/prod_in_tech"> @Prod_in_Tech</a></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Music is "A Hustler in Spite of Myself" provided by <a href="https://nadiromowale.com/">Nadir Omowale</a></p><p><br />Equipment provide by <a href="https://iconproaudio.com/">Icon Pro Audio</a></p>
