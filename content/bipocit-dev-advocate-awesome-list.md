In an episode of the [PIT Show](/blog/surfacing-the-type-of-content-you-want-to-see-part-2-with-trey-hunner), I mentioned building an awesome list for **BIPOC** (Black, Indigenous && People of Color) people in tech. I have created the list and I plan to do a lot to surface many of the folks on this list are doing.

Keep your eyes out for this one.
