## I LOVE COFFEE!

I'm always on the hunt for new cofee to sip on. 

This will be a landing page for coffee's that I've tried and things. There may be a coffee exclusive blog eventually but this is what's there for now.

> ⚠️ This page links to amazon and other shopping site. I likely have affiliate links.

## My Current Setup

### Espresso

I have a [Gaggia Classic Pro](https://amzn.to/4aHYZ8l). It's been a great machine. I've only changed the spring to a 9-bar one but I'm looking to do more mods in the future.

### Pour Over

I use a [Chemex](https://amzn.to/47r7TEp). This is what I use to make coffee for myself and guests when I'm not making espresso.
